# ML-Pipeline-Classification-Model ðŸ¤–

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for building an image classification model using data collected from the web. It's designed for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts who want to create their own classification models but lack access to suitable datasets.

The pipeline consists of two main parts:
1. Web scraping and image collection
2. Model training and evaluation

This tool is particularly useful if you're looking to build a classification model for a specific domain where pre-existing datasets are scarce or non-existent.

## Features

- Web scraping tool to collect images based on specified categories
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Configurable CNN model architecture
- Training pipeline with customizable parameters
- Evaluation metrics and visualization

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
